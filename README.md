# python_mini_project
This repository contains two Python mini-applications built to strengthen problem-solving skills and core programming concepts. These projects include expense tracking and student grade calculation, focusing on input validation, data structures, and logical workflows.

---------

1. Projects Included

1.1 Expense Tracker

A console program to record daily expenses and calculate total spending.

 
Features:

1. Accepts multiple expense items


2. Validates user input


3. Stores expenses using list of dictionaries


4. Calculates total amount spent


5. Displays summary at the end



Key Concepts Used:


while loop for continuous input

try / except for number validation

.append() to store data

List + dictionary data structure

sum() + list comprehension

1.2 Student Grade Calculator:


A script that takes marks of 5 subjects and calculates average & grade.

Features

1. Inputs student name


2. Accepts marks for 5 subjects


3. Computes average score


4. Assigns grade using conditions


5. Displays formatted result



Key Concepts Used:

for loop for repeated input

List to store marks

sum() & len() for average

if-elif-else conditional grading

Clean print output formatting
